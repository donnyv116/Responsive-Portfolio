          <p>Born Feb. 10, 1985, I am still trying to grow up. I spent a big chunck of my life tryint to be a firefight. Even worked as and EMT-B for a few years, but didn't like the time away from my family and being worn out all the time. I currently work as a purchasing agent for Linests, Inc. In my job I use Excel quit a bit. Didn't know anything about it when I started, but got a lot of practice and learned from other whenever I could.  </p>
          <p>With Excel I was constantly playing around with new function. I felt like I was creating programs. I know this was a smaller version of real programing, but it really peaked my interest. I had been looking for something new as far as work goes, when my wife found this Coding Bootcamp. I am a little overwhelmed, but loving learning something new. There are endless possiblities on what we can create. And I can NOT wait to explore more possibilities. </p>
